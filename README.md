# Linear Regression App

## Description
The Linear Regression App allows you to input your data points and make predictions based on linear regression. The app utilizes advanced mathematical computations derived from linear algebra to provide accurate and reliable predictions.

## Features
1. **Input Data Points**: Users can input their own data points directly into the app.
2. **Graphing Interface**: Visualize your data points and the resulting regression line.
3. **Background Customization**: Customize the background of your graph with either a color or an image.
4. **AI Model Creation**: Create and save your AI models for future predictions.

## Math Calculator
The core of the app's functionality lies in the `MathCalculator` class, which uses various linear algebra techniques to compute the slope and intercept of the regression line.
